    Run one market snapshot through the two-stage analysis pipeline.

    Stage 1 (free, fast): technical filter — RSI range, price above SMA50,
        SMA20 momentum. Failures are logged and the snapshot is skipped.

    Stage 2 (Claude AI): build prompt → call Claude → parse decision JSON.
        Every Claude decision is written to the decisions table.
        Actionable decisions (buy/sell, confidence >= 0.65) are additionally
        written to signals and published to stream:signals.

    Any exception is caught and logged — the main loop always continues.
